This is my first Odin project for HTML. My goal is to create linked webpages of some of my favorite recipes.
At the end of this project, I will have created a home page with links to my 3 recipes. Each of the 3 recipe
pages will an image, ordered and unordered lists, various headers, and a link back to the home page.
